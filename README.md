Premade CF stack for forwarding email from SES to your normal account.

Heavily based on [this guide](http://www.daniloaz.com/en/use-gmail-with-your-own-domain-for-free-thanks-to-amazon-ses-lambda/) and [this NodeJS lambda code](https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder), so much thanks to the authors of both of those.
